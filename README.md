### Hello!
Welcome to my git! You can find many of my projects here, passion or otherwise.

- I'm a recent Northeastern University Grad.
- I have a passion for game engines and software as play.
- I'm available for software commission and employment! I work in flight software in C#.

See my [website](https://aidancapaldi.github.io/personal-site/about) for much more about me.
