### Hello!
Welcome to my git! You can find many of my projects here, passion or otherwise.

- I'm a recent Northeastern University Grad.
- I have special interests in Generation III of Pokémon (RNG manipulation, ROM hacking) and Source-engine movement shooters (TF2).
- I'm available for software commission and employment!
    - Right now, I work in flight software / Mission Control systems in C# / Unity.

See my [website](https://aidancapaldi.github.io/personal-site/about) for much more about me.
